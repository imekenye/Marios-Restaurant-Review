## Git Commit Message - Best Practices
- keep them consistent (If you're using lowercase, keep using it)
- keep it short (~50 characters) and you can use "description" if you want
- use commit prefix:
  - feat: detect user location with geolocation api
  - fix: map issue when user didn't allow location
  - style: give layout full width/height the right way
  - docs: add 'commit prefix' to git commit best-practices
  - refactor: delete unenecessary console logs
